# Text-Steganography
The code is using text steganography to hide the message in a text file which is a poem in this case.

## Coversion of Plaintext Message into binary Format
The message to be hidden is converted to binary format on the basis of their ASCII values

 ```python
 res = ''.join(format(i, 'b') for i in bytearray(text, encoding ='utf-8'))
 print("The string after binary conversion : " + (res))
 ```

## Opening Text File and creating a Empty Steg File

```python
file1 = open("test.txt","r") 
file2 = open("Steg.txt","w+")
```

## Conversion of Text File to Steg File

We read our file line by line and bits of message bit by bit
+ If current bit is zero, then first letter of line is converted to lowercase
+ If current bit is one, then first letter of the line is converted to uppercase

```python
count = 0
while True:
  data = file1.readline()
  if(count<length):
  	if(res[count]=='1'):
        	data=data[0].lower() + data[1:] 
  file2.write(data)
  count=count+1
  if not data:
            break
```
